<p> I honestly dont know what to write in here so im just gonna right pointless things. I am studying at UiTM Kedah and its my last sem here which im gonna miss so much. My course is Information Management where mostly we're learning about information. Its fun honestly.

<p> I love wearing makeup for fun. I first started wearing makeup since i was 5 years old. I love playing with makeup ever since but i stopped as i was entering high schools but now i'm starting to wear it again.

<p> Honestly i ran out of ideas. My favourite unhealthy foods are

<li>Samyang</li>
<li>Pasta</li>
<li>Lasagna</li>
